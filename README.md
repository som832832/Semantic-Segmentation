# Semantic-Segmentation
An Efficient Semantic Segmentation Neural Network for the Detection of Diseases and Pest of Plant Leaf and Medical Diagnosis

This paper helps to solve one problem in phytopathology and two problems in medical research.
The first problem is retinal vascular segmentation for diagnosing fundus diseases. Unfortunately,
the existing methods of retinal vascular segmentation have some problems including wrong segmentation
of pathological information and low microvascular segmentation. The second problem
is to diagnose pigmented skin lesions including melanoma in complex images. The issue
with lesions image classification is that the segmentation does not identify correctly the lesions
region and the features extracted are not very pertinent. The third problem is that, it is difficult
to segment and diagnose Alternaria disease and Leaf‑minear pest on tomato leaves due to
the similarity of their colored areas in the early and middle stages of their outbreak. Therefore,
to solve the first problem, this research has used DRIVE database (digital retinal images for vessel
extraction). To unravel the second problem, which is the diagnosis of skin lesions including
melanoma, image dataset from the Atlas Dermoscopy has been used. Finally, this research has
used a unique database consisting of 172 images of tomato leaves infected with both types of
Alternaria disease and Leaf‑minear pest and 100 healthy tomato leaves to untie the third hurdle.
For the purpose of targeted segmentation, the images in this database have been collected in
the early and middle stages of outbreak of the Alternaria disease and Leaf‑minear pest on tomato
leaves. This paper has developed and utilized an Efficient semantic segmentation neural network
(E‑SCNN) to solve three foregoing problems. The proposed method has used Softmax classifier
for classifing these three problems. The test of proposed method in RGB, YCBCR and HSV color
spaces showed that this method has good accuracy and speed in all three color spaces for Retinal
vascular segmentation of diagnosing fundus diseases, and for skin lesions segmentation, as
well as for segmentation of Alternaria disease and Leaf‑minear pest. RGB color space had better
performance than YCBCR and HSV color spaces for solving three foregoing problems. Results
showed that the proposed method achieved an accuracy of 96.91Results also demonstrated that
the proposed method achieved an accuracy of 99.25Additionally, the results indicated that the
proposed method achieved an accuracy of 96.13Proposed method compared to the best previous
method on DRIVE database proved that accuracy has increased by In addition, proposed
method compared to the best previous method on the Atlas Dermoscopy database, showed that
accuracy has increased by Equally, in comparison, proposed method has Proposed E‑SCNN has
submitted a type of deep learning architecture that has high accuracy and speed even in datasets
with a small number of images. Proposed E‑SCNN has low sensitivity to the light intensity of images,
and has practical application in solving various medical and phytopathology problems and
many other problems as well.
